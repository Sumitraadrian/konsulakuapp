## What problem do we want to address?

Skin diseases are one of the most common health problems faced by people. Accurate and timely diagnosis of skin diseases is essential for effective treatment. However, the diagnosis process is often time-consuming and requires the expertise of an experienced doctor. Many people do not have sufficient knowledge about skin diseases and their treatments. This can lead to delays in seeking medical attention and inappropriate use of medication. Thus, delayed treatment can worsen the condition and increase the risk of complications.

## Summary
KonsulaAku is a product in the form of a chatbot that will facilitate users in interacting, where users can provide images related to skin diseases experienced so that the chatbot can later detect the type of skin disease. Then the chatbot provides responses related to skin disease matters such as recommendations for treatment needed as an initial step (first aid).

The KonsulAku application is in line with point 3 of the SDGs, namely **Good Health and Well-Being**, where this application facilitates early diagnosis and drug advice for skin diseases. By providing quick and easily accessible information on skin conditions, the cahtbot encourages users to contact medical help in a timely manner, thereby improving health outcomes and reducing the burden of untreated skin diseases.
